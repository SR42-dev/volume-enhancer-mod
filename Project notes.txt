Audio mixer idea 

	- inputs to assess volume comfort & song choice comfort
	- webcam(emotions), ecg, earphones
	- microphones listen to music in surroundings and use it to predict 
	- potentially add nlp to figure out keywords that attract users to lyrics
	- check goosebump detection

Steps :

	- Phase 1 - manal volume input, map to amplitude variation of the song, feed data into model and extract reading
		
		1. Predict genre using spectrogram 
		2. Take zero crossing rate
		3. Take spectral centroid
		4. Take spectral rolloff
		5. Take MFCC
		6. Feed 2, 3, 4, 5 data with 1 result to a second network to get volume

	- Phase 2 - <frequency variation mapping to emotional state>
